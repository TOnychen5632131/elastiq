      David is one of the rare people who know how to write scalable and readable CSS. He strives for perfection and his systematic approach makes it easy to pick up where he left. David taught me that there is more to CSS than spaghetti and pixels.

      With his passion for concepts, systems and interactions, David fills the gap between design and frontend. He is a great ambassador and advisor for modularity and taxonomy, adding value to every single project I worked with him. David is a true craftman when it comes to animations. Always tweaking and seeking to improve the user experience to its max. With his attitude and style, working with him was not only rewarding but also refreshing.
