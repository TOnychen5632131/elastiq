      getting really complicated as smooth transitions aligned with its context
      makes the difference. How to effectively balance between user experience
      and front-end development considering the variety of browsers to be
      supported, David showed impressively how best in class animations feels
      like elevating the project to a significant showcase in the insurance
      industry.
